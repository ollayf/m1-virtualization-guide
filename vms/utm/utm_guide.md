# UTM
This actually uses QEMU in the backend, but its a much simpler interface, and acts as a whole VM as well. It is **free** if you download from [Web](https://mac.getutm.app/) rather than the literal same app on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-virtual-machines/id1538878817). The only difference being that UTM will not nudge you for updates. AND doing the latter supports the development team.
